    "This project analyzes housing data from [King County Assessor Data](https://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/DataDownload/default.aspx) to help a startup create an app to find and recommend housing deals. Statistical analysis of this data shows that **square footage** of living space, whether or not the property is on a **waterfront**, and its **zip code** are the best predictors of sale price. Further data collection and analysis should be done to develop a more reliable model."

My task is to analyze the housing data to find what features of a property best determine the sale price. The company will use this information to recommend properties to customers which are priced below the model's price."

    "### Initial Feature Selection\n",
    "To begin deciding what features to include in my model, I looked at how each variable correlated with `price` and chose `sqft_living`, `grade`, `bathrooms`, `bedrooms`, `view`, `sqft_basement`, `waterfront` and `greenbelt`. I also decided to include `zipcode`, to account for changes in price based on location of the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "To begin my model iteration, I included all of the relevant features. Then I removed one feature at a time starting with any feature with a p-value larger than 0.01. Then I removed the feature with the smallest absolute coefficient as that means it has the least effect of `price`. I used the adjusted R-squared value, Mean Absolute Error, and Conditional Number to judge the model and help me decide when to stop removing features. I have also normalized each numeric feature to make it easier to compare their coefficients. \n",

    "The coefficient for `sqft_living_norm` is about \\\\$292,100. This means for each increase of 1 standard deviation of square foot of living space in the home, we see an associated increase of about \\\\$292,100. Since the standard deviation of `sqft_living` is about 836, for every increase of 1 square foot of living space, we can expect and increase of about \\\\$349 in sale price. \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "***\n",
    "Based on our final model, the three features which best determine sale price are:\n",
    "* **sqft_living** - Square footage of living space in the home\n",
    "* **waterfront** - Whether the house is on a waterfront\n",
    "* **zipcode** - The 5-digit zip code assigned by the U.S. Postal Service. Only includes zip codes in King County, WA.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would advise the startup to gather these three pieces of data for houses currently on the market in King County, WA and recommend houses where the sale price is below what our model would determine.  "

    "### Limitations\n",
    "There does not appear to be a linear relationship between our predictor and target variables. The residuals of our final model are also not normally distributed. Failing these two assumptions for linear regression should cast doubt as to the results of the model. This indicates that there are likely other factors that affect price which are not included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite including more data than the original dataset, we are still limited by our dataset, which doesn't include other factors in determining price, such as the federal interest rate at the time of the sale, housing availability, and other qualities of the neighborhood where each property is located.
